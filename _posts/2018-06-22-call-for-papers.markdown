#### __19th Brazilian Logic Conference__
##### May 6-10, 2019 -- João Pessoa / PB, Brazil

The Brazilian Logic Conference (EBL) is a traditional event of the Brazilian Logic Society (SBL). They have been occurring since 1979. It congregates logicians of different fields and the meeting is an important moment for the Brazilian and South-American community to join together and engage in a discussion about the state-of-art of their subject. The areas of Logic covered spread over Foundations and Philosophy of Science, Mathematics, Computer Science, Informatics, Linguistics, and Artificial Intelligence.

Previous editions of the EBL have attracted researchers from all over Latin America and elsewhere. The EBL is an event bringing together logicians of different levels and skills: from undergraduate students to senior researchers.

In 2019, the EBL will be held at João Pessoa, capital of the state of Paraíba, a charming town on the Brazialian coast.

The goal of the EBL meeting is to encourage the dissemination and discussion of research papers in Logic in a broad sense. It is expected to have among the participants several invited speakers from different continents.

#### Topics

We cordially invite submissions of contributed papers on the general topics of Logic, including:

- Philosophical and Mathematical Logic, and Applications,
- History and Philosophy of Logic,
- Non-classical Logic and Applications,
- Philosophy of Formal Sciences,
- Foundations of Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics,
- Logic Education,

among others.

#### Submission

Abstracts to be submitted should be written in Portuguese, Spanish or English with a maximum of 300 words including title, name, keywords, affiliation and the essential bibliography.

We are happy to host round tables proposals with a duration of at most two hours. They may be divided as desired, with a maximum of 4 and a minimum of 3 participants per session. The description and the title for the session should be of a maximum of 1500 words containing an abstract for each exposition including title, name, keywords, affiliation and bibliography. Each session must have a coordinating chair assigned in the proposal.

The author(s) should send a .pdf file by email to XXXX@XXXX until Jan 5, 2019.

Papers may be presented in Portuguese, Spanish or English, to fit a slot of 20 minutes (exposition) + 10 minutes (questions).

The Scientific Committee will consider the following items when selecting the accepted papers:

- Relevance and importance of the topic
- Originality
- Quality of work

The list of accepted papers will be released on Feb 4, 2019. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for presenting the paper at the meeting. Each given participant may coauthor more than one paper, but will only be allowed to present a single talk.

The EBL 2019 also aims to be a forum for presenting and discussing work in progress and therefore to provide feedback for authors on their preliminary research. The proceedings are produced after the meeting, so that authors can incorporate the feedback received in the published papers.

There will also be a Logic School on the weekend previous to the conference (speakers and subjects to be announced).
