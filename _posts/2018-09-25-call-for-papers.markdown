#### __19th Brazilian Logic Conference__
##### May 6-10, 2019 -- João Pessoa / PB, Brazil

The Brazilian Logic Conferences (EBL) is a traditional event of the Brazilian Logic Society (SBL). It has been occurring since 1979. Congregating logicians of different fields and with different backgrounds – from undergraduate students to senior researchers – the meeting is an important moment for the Brazilian and South-American logical community to join together and discuss recent developments of the field. The areas of Logic covered spread over Foundations and Philosophy of Science, Analytic Philosophy, Mathematics, Computer Science, Informatics, Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence.

Previous editions of the EBL have attracted researchers from all over Latin America and elsewhere. In 2019, the EBL will be held at João Pessoa, capital of the state of Paraíba, a charming and beautiful town on the Brazilian north-east coast.

The goal of the EBL meeting is to encourage the dissemination and discussion of research papers in Logic in a broad sense. It is expected to have among the participants several invited speakers from different continents.
